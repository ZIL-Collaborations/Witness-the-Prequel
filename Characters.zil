"G A M E  -  Characters File"

"THE CAST"

"This consists of a collection of characters. There must be at least one
character in order to represent the player's role in the game. The ZILF Library
provides a standard player character which may be used by any game. A game may
have more characters and may even have alternate player characters. Each
character can carry property and wear clothing."

"Characters, their property and clothing are defined in ZIL as objects."
