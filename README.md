# Witness: The Prequel

## Concept

See Jason's original Intfiction post [here](https://intfiction.org/t/iso-zil-surgeon-interested-in-franken-witness/45989).

And here is Jason's pitch (extracted from Discord discussion):
"The nice part about Witness: The Prequel is that the map is already made. :) If I were to sit down and start working on it, I'd start with outlining the basics: you're Monica, in the workshop, you've gotta do thing X, Y, and Z before the doorbell rings, and these are the obstacles (you need Phong's help to do Y, and you can't let Linder see you do Z, for example) and then from there it would probably be a collaboration on "okay is that actually any good" and then "okay now what else do we implement for unexpected/bad/dumb/wrong actions, and losing cases other than 'you didn't finish setting up the murder plot before the doorbell rang'"?)"

"My starting concept is that the game begins at 7:00 pm. Monica is (you are) in the workshop putting the finishing touches on the plastic explosive or whatever. At 8:0x the doorbell will ring and Phong will open the door for The Detective, so by then you've gotta do some set of tasks like:

- wire up the explosive and make sure not to leave prints/footprints
- get the fake medical report (maybe your low-key girlfriend comes and drops it off?) and put it where it belongs
- make sure the muddy handgun is planted correctly (I forget offhand if the game tells us who is the likely one to have done that--Phong?)
- get the clock gun (from Linder) and plant it in the clock to his satisfaction
- Readjust the clock gun to your satisfaction without Linder or Phong seeing

(and maybe those are enough)

So, although the start time could of course vary, as I've described it, that's a game with a hard stop of about 70 moves."

"And there's some sort of management of player knowledge with, let's say, a to-do list ("lightly clued" as the kids say these days, although... am I right in thinking that the 2020 standard for "properly clued" games are to intercept any valid player input that isn't the right answer and then basically tell the player what the right answer is?) and the last important step would be to eat or flush the list so the detective can't find it later. :)"

"That's a point for discussion... my original concept was that the "winning" state is actually the one which sets up the events of The Witness -- you do all the "right" things which set up the world as The Detective finds it, there's no way provided to get away scot free. (And some other outcomes which, kind of like The Witness does already, let you ask for a more detailed explanation of what's going to happen based on what you did/didn't do. So, like, if you fail to set the gun correctly you can ask for the full epilogue which explains that, yeah, Linder's plot happens as he planned and Stiles is held for attempted murder but quickly released because the evidence is so flimsy and there was obvious funny-business at the house which only further dishonors the family, blah blah.)
A way to make it the Perfect Crime rendering The Witness unwinnable would subvert the idea of it being a true prequel..."
