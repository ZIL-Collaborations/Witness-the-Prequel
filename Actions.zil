"G A M E  -  Actions File"

"THE INTERACTION"

"This consists of a collection of actions. It is not always necessary to define
actions but there may, in principle, be as many as are required to support the
game."

"Actions are constructed in ZIL from verb routines and their associated syntax
definitions."

"Note: as at ZILF 0.9, there is no mechanism to replace syntax definitions in
the ZILF library other than by editing a copy of verbs.zil. See ZILF Issue #42"
